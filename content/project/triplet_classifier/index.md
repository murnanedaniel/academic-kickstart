Exa.TrkX is a DOE CompHEP project that will scale up the optimization, performance, and validation studies of ML tracking models to unprecedented levels, enabling HEP to develop production-quality tracking that runs efficiently on the next generation of hybrid-accelerated computing architectures, from the experiments online triggering systems to DOE exascale-class HPC systems.
