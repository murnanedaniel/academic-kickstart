I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Research Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We are using [Graph Neural Networks](https://medium.com/@terngoodod/a-comprehensive-survey-on-graph-neural-networks-part-1-types-of-graph-neural-network-1dd93b823c70 "GNN Survey") to solve problems in high energy particle physics. Currently, I am working on classifying [tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(particle_physics) "What is a track?") of hits, left as particles move through the [detectors of the Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/experiments/how-detector-works "How does a detector work"). This is to prepare for the potentially 100x increase in data of the [High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/resources/faqs?text=high-luminosity&field_p_faq_display_topic_target_id=All&field_p_faq_display_audience_target_id=All "HL-LHC FAQ"). 

I also maintain a keen interest in the application of this data to new physics, including composite models, dark matter, supersymmetry and grand unification. I am currently working on a global fit of available data to the [Minimal Composite Higgs model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_Higgs_models "Composite Higgs models"), as well as studying the fine tuning of this class of models. 

This page is a work-in-progress. Depending on its status, you might find information about my music projects, coding/business ideas, or random musings.
