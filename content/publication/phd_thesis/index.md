abstract: "While the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics contains the most precise set of predictions ever devised by humanity, that precision comes at a cost. The strange nature of the Higgs particle requires its parameters to be tuned so precisely that if the SM is indeed the true description of reality, one is forced to wonder how such a miracle as galactic structure and life could occur. Instead, we search in this work for a natural explanation. The concept of naturalness is comprehensively explored, and a new tuning measure proposed, with an aim to place it on well-defined Bayesian footing. We then turn this measure on to the analysis of a class of intriguing new physics - Composite Higgs models. These effective models are the result of a plethora of underlying theories, and they allow the production of a naturally light Higgs particle, appearing as the SM Higgs at low energy. We establish the background required to appreciate the N-site 4D Composite Higgs model, and subsequently focus on the simplest incarnations of this class. A global fit is performed on the Minimal 4D Composite Higgs model (M4DCHM), with strong exclusion bounds placed on collider search channels. We analyse any improvement in tuning that could be gained from several extensions to this model. The Leptonic M4DCHM is explored, with a composite tau lepton embedded in various representations. The possibility of a dark matter candidate existing in the Next-to-Minimal 4DCHM is considered. Ultimately, we are able to define what, if any, benefit to naturalness can come to the Composite Higgs sector by introducing these extensions."
